			<h1>Stereopix viewer examples</h1>

			<p>Here, we will present some examples to use the viewer of <a href="https://stereopix.net/">Stereopix</a> in your own website. It is a complement to the help page of the website. Remember that the files you want to load in the viewer should all be served in HTTPS with the CORS headers set to allow <tt>https://stereopix.net</tt>.</p>

			<p>Have the curiosity to inspect the source code of these pages on this website or in the <a href="https://github.com/stereopix-viewer-examples/stereopix-viewer-examples.github.io">GitHub repository</a>. This one additionnaly contains a mini HTTPS server giving CORS permissions written in python (with self-generated certificate that you would have to temporary allow) that could help you to test on your local machine.</p>
